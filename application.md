# GSoC Organization Application

## Why does your org want to participate in GSoC?

The Ruby org provides an umbrella org for both the Ruby language itself and for developer tools and other projects written in Ruby.
We want to participate in order to grow the Ruby open source community, help students develop their programming and project management skills, and improve the experience of using Ruby for everyone.
We also provide a space for different parts of the Ruby ecosystem to come together and collaborate, and provide the opportunity for students to participate in a wider community than a single software project.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

5-10

So far, 7 developers have said they could potentially mentor this year.
We hope to increase that number during the application period.

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

Every mentor-student relationship is different, but our mentors stay in daily contact with their students via Slack.
Students not only provide regular updates, but are encouraged to keep up an open line of communication with their mentors, asking questions when they are stuck and continuosly refining their project design (since no PRD survives contact with code).
Mentors provide regular feedback to their students, not waiting until the formal feedback periods to help the students grow as open source contributors.

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

We expect students to be in daily communication with their mentors.
Mentors will evaluate daily and weekly progress and help their students focus on completing the most important parts of their projects, instead of getting lost while working in a large codebase.
Additionally, mentors will help their students avoid scope creep, by sticking to minimum viable feature implementations unless time allows for building more bells and whistles.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Students join the project slack channel prior to submitting their applications.
Mentors, other students, and other contributors are all available to the students from the community bonding period onwards, and we expect students to spend that time exploring the codebase they'll be working in.
Students are expected to work like any other contributor, and experience that responsibility.

## How will you keep your students involved in your community after GSoC?

We do our best to get students work merged upstream before the end of the summer, giving them a sense of pride and accomplishment with their work on the project.
Because they've spent a summer acting as a maintainer for the project, taking on those same responsibilities, they're able to continue in the same mode of work as members of the community.

## Has your org been accepted as a mentor org in GSoC before?

Yes.

## Which years did you participate in GSoC?

2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020.

## For each year your org has participated, provide the counts of successful and total students:

- 2015: 6/10
- 2016: 9/12
- 2018: 5/6
- 2019: 4/5
- 2020: 3/4

## If your org has applied for GSoC before but not been accepted, select the years:

None

## Provide a reference: (optional)

Intentionally left blank since we're not a first-time org

## What year was your project started?

1995

The Ruby language had its first release in 1995, RubyGems was created during a Ruby conference in 2004, and Bundler saw its first release in 2009.

## Where does your source code live?

https://github.com/ruby, https://github.com/bundler, https://github.com/rubygems

## Anything else we should know?

This is an umbrella project that has successfully overseen GSoC projects across the Ruby ecosystem over the summers.
We've also been successful in converting former students to mentors, which is an incredible fulfilling experience.
